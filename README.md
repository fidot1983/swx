This is a repository of most used aircraft hardware models. Primarily courtesy of Bill Rose of the Biplane Forum (biplaneforum.com) fame, I also have added a few models of mine. 

All files are organized into directories by minimum SWX version required. 

Please note that I do not guarantee correctness or accuracy of these models. For educational use only. Not to be used in aircraft design and / or construction. 

Please report issues thru the "Issues" menu on the right and I will fix them if at all possible. 

If you wish, file an issue for new models required. I will try to accomodate on best effort basis. Please note that I am doing this for fun, so do not expect any kind of guaranteed turnaround. 

If you have models to submit and know how to use GIT, feel free to fork, add them and submit pull requests. If you don't know how to use GIT, just ping me thru Biplane Forum (http://biplaneforum.com, 'fidot' is the nickname) or submit an issue here and I will contact you.
